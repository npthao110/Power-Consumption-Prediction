# Power-Consumption-Prediction

Power consumption in different zones in a city area can be affected by weather parameters, the landscape and the type of occupancy (residential/industrial etc). In this project, we will analyze the data of power consumtion for year 2017 in 3 different zones in a city named Tetuan in Morocco. We will find three best fitted data models to predict the power consumptions in the three different zones.
